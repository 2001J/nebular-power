## System Overview

The Solar Energy Monitoring and Financing System is designed as a modern, scalable application following a multi-tier architecture. The system is built using Spring Boot for the backend, with a responsive web frontend, and integrates with solar installation hardware through a dedicated API.

### Key Design Goals

1. **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle from single installations to large-scale solar farms with thousands of monitoring points.

2. **Reliability**: Critical components have redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.

3. **Security**: The system implements industry-standard security practices to protect sensitive user and financial data.

4. **Extensibility**: The modular design allows for easy addition of new features and integration with external systems.

5. **Performance**: The system is optimized for handling large volumes of time-series data with efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms.

### Design Patterns

The system implements several design patterns to address common challenges:

- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Service Layer Pattern**: For business logic encapsulation
- **MVC Pattern**: For web interface implementation
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating complex objects
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling and notifications
- **Strategy Pattern**: For implementing interchangeable algorithms

### Technology Stack Overview

- **Backend**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.3.4, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14 (production), H2 (development/testing)
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Material-UI
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional)

## How to Use This Documentation

This design documentation is organized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system from an architectural and design perspective. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of the system design:

- Start with the [System Architecture](./architecture.md) to understand the high-level structure and design principles.
- Explore the [Component Diagrams](./components.md) to understand how different parts of the system interact.
- Review the [Database Design](./database.md) to understand the data model and relationships.
- Consult the [API Documentation](./api.md) for details on integrating with or extending the system.
- Study the [Security Design](./security.md) to understand how the system protects data and manages access.

For implementation details, refer to the [Implementation Documentation](../implementation/README.md).
