- Consider stateless design for core services
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

### 3. Testability

- Design components with testability in mind
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for each component
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Use mock objects to isolate components during testing

### 4. Security

- Implement security at the component level
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate all inputs at component boundaries
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### 5. Performance

- Optimize critical paths through components
