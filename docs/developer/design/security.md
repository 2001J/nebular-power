## Authentication Mechanism

### Authentication Flow

The system uses a token-based authentication mechanism based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

1. User submits credentials (username/password)
2. Server validates credentials against the database
3. If valid, server generates a JWT token and a refresh token
4. Tokens are returned to the client
5. Client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. When the JWT token expires, client uses the refresh token to obtain a new JWT token

### JWT Token Structure

```
Header:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload:
{
  "sub": "user@example.com",
  "userId": 123,
  "roles": ["OWNER"],
  "iat": 1621512000,
  "exp": 1621515600
}

Signature:
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

### Token Management

- **Access Token Lifetime**: 1 hour
- **Refresh Token Lifetime**: 30 days
- **Token Storage**: 
  - Client-side: Stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict
  - Server-side: Refresh tokens are stored in the database with a reference to the user

### Multi-Factor Authentication

The system supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security:

1. **Email-based verification**: One-time codes sent to the user's email
2. **Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)**: Compatible with authenticator apps
3. **SMS-based verification**: One-time codes sent to the user's phone

MFA is required for:
- Initial account setup
- Password changes
- Access from new devices
- Administrative actions

### Password Policies

The system enforces the following password policies:

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Complexity requirements: Must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Password history: Prevents reuse of the last 5 passwords
- Maximum age: 90 days
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts result in a 30-minute lockout

## Authorization Framework

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements role-based access control with the following roles:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| ADMIN | System administrator | Full access to all system functions |
| MANAGER | Installation manager | Manage multiple installations, view data, generate reports |
| OWNER | Installation owner | View and manage owned installations |
| VIEWER | Read-only user | View data for specific installations |
| FINANCIAL_ADMIN | Financial administrator | Manage financial aspects of installations |

### Permission Model

Permissions are granular and assigned to roles:

| Permission | Description | Roles |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| USER_CREATE | Create user accounts | ADMIN |
| USER_READ | View user information | ADMIN, MANAGER |
| USER_UPDATE | Update user information | ADMIN, self |
| USER_DELETE | Delete user accounts | ADMIN |
| INSTALLATION_CREATE | Create installations | ADMIN, MANAGER |
| INSTALLATION_READ | View installation details | ADMIN, MANAGER, OWNER, VIEWER |
| INSTALLATION_UPDATE | Update installation details | ADMIN, MANAGER, OWNER |
| INSTALLATION_DELETE | Delete installations | ADMIN |
| ENERGY_DATA_READ | View energy data | ADMIN, MANAGER, OWNER, VIEWER |
| SUMMARY_GENERATE | Generate energy summaries | ADMIN, MANAGER |
| SUMMARY_READ | View energy summaries | ADMIN, MANAGER, OWNER, VIEWER |
| PAYMENT_CREATE | Create payments | ADMIN, FINANCIAL_ADMIN |
| PAYMENT_READ | View payments | ADMIN, FINANCIAL_ADMIN, OWNER |
| INVOICE_CREATE | Create invoices | ADMIN, FINANCIAL_ADMIN |
| INVOICE_READ | View invoices | ADMIN, FINANCIAL_ADMIN, OWNER |

### Access Control Implementation

Access control is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Controller Level**: Spring Security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`) check permissions before method execution
2. **Service Level**: Additional permission checks in service methods
3. **Data Level**: Query filters ensure users only see data they have access to
4. **UI Level**: Interface elements are shown/hidden based on user permissions

Example controller method with security annotation:

```java
@GetMapping("/{id}")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or @securityService.hasAccessToInstallation(#id)")
public ResponseEntity<Installation> getInstallation(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

### Installation-Specific Access Control

The system implements a custom security service to check if a user has access to a specific installation:

```java
public boolean hasAccessToInstallation(Long installationId) {
    Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
    String username = authentication.getName();
    
    return installationUserRepository.existsByInstallationIdAndUserUsername(
        installationId, username);
}
```

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

The system classifies data into the following categories:

| Classification | Description | Examples |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Public | Information that can be freely disclosed | Installation locations, general system information |
| Internal | Information for authenticated users | Energy production statistics, installation specifications |
| Confidential | Sensitive information | User contact information, payment details |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information | Passwords, authentication tokens, financial data |

### Encryption

#### Data in Transit

All data transmitted between clients and the server is encrypted using TLS 1.3:

- HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled
- Modern cipher suites are used
- Perfect Forward Secrecy is enabled
- Certificate pinning is implemented in mobile applications

#### Data at Rest

Sensitive data stored in the database is encrypted:

- **Passwords**: Hashed using bcrypt with a work factor of 12
- **Personal Information**: Encrypted using AES-256 in GCM mode
- **Financial Data**: Encrypted using AES-256 in GCM mode
- **API Keys and Secrets**: Encrypted using AES-256 in GCM mode

### Key Management

- Encryption keys are stored in a secure key management system (AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault)
- Keys are rotated regularly (every 90 days)
- Access to keys is strictly controlled and audited

### Data Minimization and Retention

- Only necessary data is collected and stored
- Personal data is anonymized where possible
- Data retention periods are defined and enforced:
  - User account data: Retained while account is active, deleted 30 days after account closure
  - Energy data: Retained for 5 years, then archived
  - Financial data: Retained for 7 years to comply with financial regulations
  - Logs: Retained for 1 year, then archived

## API Security

### Input Validation

All API inputs are validated:

- **Type validation**: Ensures inputs are of the correct data type
- **Range validation**: Ensures numeric values are within acceptable ranges
- **Format validation**: Ensures strings match expected formats (e.g., email addresses)
- **Size validation**: Ensures inputs don't exceed size limits
- **Content validation**: Ensures content doesn't contain malicious code

Example validation annotations:

```java
public class InstallationRequest {
    @NotBlank(message = "Name is required")
    @Size(max = 100, message = "Name must be less than 100 characters")
    private String name;
    
    @NotBlank(message = "Location is required")
    @Size(max = 255, message = "Location must be less than 255 characters")
    private String location;
    
    @NotNull(message = "Capacity is required")
    @Positive(message = "Capacity must be greater than 0")
    private BigDecimal capacityKw;
    
    // Other fields and methods
}
```

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse:

- **Anonymous requests**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated requests**: 1000 requests per hour per user
- **Admin users**: 5000 requests per hour

Rate limits are enforced using a token bucket algorithm and are configurable per endpoint.

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to restrict which domains can access the API:

```java
@Configuration
public class CorsConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/api/**")
            .allowedOrigins("https://app.solarenergysystem.com")
            .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE")
            .allowedHeaders("Authorization", "Content-Type")
            .allowCredentials(true)
            .maxAge(3600);
    }
}
```

### API Versioning

API versioning ensures backward compatibility and secure deprecation of vulnerable endpoints:

- New versions are created when breaking changes are introduced
- Old versions are maintained for a deprecation period
- Security vulnerabilities in old versions are patched or the version is deprecated immediately

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

The system is protected by multiple firewall layers:

- **Network Firewall**: Restricts traffic to necessary ports (80, 443, 22)
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protects against common web attacks
- **Database Firewall**: Restricts database access to application servers only

### DDoS Protection

Protection against Distributed Denial of Service attacks includes:

- **Traffic filtering**: Drops malicious traffic
- **Rate limiting**: Restricts the number of requests from a single IP
- **CDN**: Distributes traffic across multiple edge locations
- **Auto-scaling**: Increases capacity during traffic spikes

### VPN Access

Administrative access to production systems requires VPN authentication:

- Multi-factor authentication is required for VPN access
- VPN sessions expire after 8 hours of inactivity
- VPN access is logged and audited

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

The system implements comprehensive security monitoring:

- **Log aggregation**: All logs are centralized in a SIEM system
- **Intrusion detection**: Monitors for suspicious activities
- **Anomaly detection**: Identifies unusual patterns of behavior
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Regular scans for known vulnerabilities
- **Penetration testing**: Annual tests by external security experts

### Incident Response Plan

A formal incident response plan is in place:

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm security incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Post-incident analysis**: Learn from the incident and improve security

### Security Alerts

The system generates alerts for security events:

- **Failed login attempts**: Multiple failures trigger alerts
- **Privilege escalation**: Changes to user permissions are logged and alerted
- **Unusual access patterns**: Access from new locations or at unusual times
- **Configuration changes**: Changes to security settings are logged and alerted
