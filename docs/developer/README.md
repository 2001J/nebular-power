## How to Use This Documentation

This developer documentation is organized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system from a technical perspective. If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the System Architecture section to get an overview of how the system is structured.

For specific implementation details, refer to the Implementation section. If you're interested in testing the system or contributing to its development, the Testing and Contributing sections will be most relevant.

Each section includes detailed information, code examples, and diagrams where appropriate to help you understand the system's technical aspects.
