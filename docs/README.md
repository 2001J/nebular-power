# Solar Energy Monitoring and Financing System Documentation

## Abstract
The Solar Energy Monitoring and Financing System is a comprehensive platform that enables real-time monitoring of solar energy production/consumption, financial management of solar investments, and detailed analytics. Built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and React.js, the system provides role-based access control, customizable dashboards, and automated reporting. It serves solar installation owners, managers, and administrators with tools to optimize energy usage, maximize ROI, and ensure regulatory compliance.
