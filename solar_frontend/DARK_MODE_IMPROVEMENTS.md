# Dark Mode Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the dark mode implementation in the solar energy management system frontend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dark Mode Color Scheme

The dark mode color scheme in `globals.css` has been updated to use a more pleasant dark blue-gray palette instead of the near-black colors. This improves readability and reduces eye strain while maintaining good contrast for accessibility.

```css
.dark {
  --background: 222 47% 11%;
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  /* Other color variables... */
}
```

### 2. Added Theme Toggle to Customer Layout

The theme toggle component has been added to the customer layout, giving customers the ability to switch between light and dark modes, just like administrators have.

```jsx
<div className="ml-auto flex items-center gap-4">
  <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Welcome, {user.name}</span>
  
  <ModeToggle />

  <DropdownMenu>
    {/* ... */}
  </DropdownMenu>
</div>
```

### 3. Updated Customer Layout to Use Theme-Aware Classes

The customer layout has been updated to use theme-aware classes instead of hardcoded colors. This ensures that the layout adapts properly to dark mode.

```jsx
<div className="flex min-h-screen bg-background">
  {/* Top header */}
  <header className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 h-14 bg-card border-b flex items-center px-4">
    {/* ... */}
  </header>
  
  {/* ... */}
  
  {/* Mobile navigation */}
  <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 md:hidden bg-card border-t flex justify-around py-2">
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Improved Chart Visibility in Dark Mode

The charts in the customer section have been updated to use theme-aware colors. This ensures that the charts are properly visible in both light and dark modes.

```jsx
// Theme-aware chart colors
const chartColors = {
  grid: theme === 'dark' ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)' : 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  referenceLine: theme === 'dark' ? '#ffffff' : '#000000',
  production: {
    stroke: '#16a34a',
    fill: theme === 'dark' ? 'rgba(22, 163, 74, 0.5)' : 'rgba(22, 163, 74, 0.3)'
  },
  consumption: {
    stroke: '#ef4444',
    fill: theme === 'dark' ? 'rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.5)' : 'rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3)'
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: The updated dark mode color scheme provides better contrast and reduces eye strain.
2. **Consistent User Experience**: Both administrators and customers now have access to the same theme toggle functionality.
3. **Better Chart Visibility**: Charts now adapt to the current theme, ensuring that all elements are visible in both light and dark modes.
4. **Accessibility**: The improved color contrast enhances accessibility for users with visual impairments.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a system preference detection to automatically switch between light and dark modes based on the user's system preferences.
2. Implement smooth transitions between light and dark modes to improve the user experience.
3. Add more theme options (e.g., high contrast, sepia) for users with specific visual needs.
